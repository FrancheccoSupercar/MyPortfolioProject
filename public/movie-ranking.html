<h1>The Best Movies According to Francesco</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Braveheart</h3>
<p>I've seen this movie hundreds of times. The landscapes, the courage, the love for his homeland and his beloved, the determination
    and the strength are all traits that have inspired me since I first saw William Wallace.</p>
<h3>Harry Potter (every Episode ^_^)</h3>
<p>Poetry, fairy tale, and intrigue. These characteristics make this movie series unparalleled (IMHO).</p>
<h3>The Big Bang Theory</h3>
<p>This series is beyond words... it is simply a pure source of inspiration.</p>
